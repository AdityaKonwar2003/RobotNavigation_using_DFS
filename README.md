# RobotNavigation_using_DFS

Overview

This project demonstrates robot navigation in a simple maze using Depth-First Search (DFS).
The robot starts from a given position and finds a path to the goal while avoiding walls.

The project also includes visualization of the maze and the discovered path using Matplotlib.

#Features

Maze representation using a 2D grid

DFS-based pathfinding

Path reconstruction from start to goal

Visual display of robot path
